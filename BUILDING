1. Run "cmake ." in this directory
2. Run "make" 

This will create all tests in the "bin"-folder and the libraries in the source folder (in source build).
If you want to an out of source build, just change the cmake command.


By default, the debug symbols are enabled. This is not recommended for code that should perform well.
To disable the debug symbols in order to increase the execution speed, run
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
and in order to change back to debug-mode
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
